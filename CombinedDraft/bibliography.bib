abstract = {During a span of 10,000 years or more, Native Americans in the Nevada were sustained by hunting and fishing, gathering, lithic quarrying, and trading. To meet their requirements for firewood, fish and game, vegetal foods, craft supplies, and building materials, the native peoples of the Sierra managed biotic resources intensively, with significant ecological and evolutionary consequences. The distribution, structure, composition, and extent of certain plant communities, for example, were shaped by burning, pruning, sowing, weeding, tilling, and selective harvesting. Numerous “protoagricultural” techniques, based upon traditional knowledge of natural processes gained over the millennia, were applied to increase the quantity and improve select qualities of focal plant species. Fire was the most important management tool, employed to clear brush, maintain grasslands and meadows, improve browse for deer, enhance production of basketry and cordage materials, modify understory species composition in forests, and reduce fuel accumulation that might otherwise sustain intense fires. Considering that the human population of the Sierra Nevada was approximately 90,000–100,000 in late prehistoric times (ca. A.D. 1300–1800), the environmental consequences fof aboriginal land-use and management practices were substantial. There is currently an ecological “vacuum,” or disequilibrium, in the Sierra resulting from the departure of Native American influences. The recent decline in biotic diversity, species extirpation and endangerment, human encroachment into fire-type plant communities (e.g., chaparral), and greatly increased risk of catastrophic fires are but symptoms of this disequilibrium. It is recommended, therefore,$\backslash$nthat land-managing agencies and land-use planners incorporate Native American traditional knowledge into future policies andprograms for ecosystem management in the Sierra Nevada. This traditional knowledge, which permitted the adaptive success of large human populations and the maintenance of Sierran environments for more than a hundred centuries, must not be dismissed.},

abstract = {The Kyoto protocol has focused the attention of the public and policymarkers on the earth's carbon (C) budget. Previous estimates of the impacts of vegetation change have been limited to equilibrium snapshots that could not capture nonlinear or threshold effects along the trajectory of change. New models have been designed to complement equilibrium models and simulate vegetation succession through time while estimating variability in the C budget and responses to episodic events such as drought and fire. In addition, a plethora of future climate scenarios has been used to produce a bewildering variety of simulated ecological responses. Our objectives were to use an equilibrium model (Mapped Atmosphere–Plant–Soil system, or MAPSS) and a dynamic model (MC1) to (a) simulate changes in potential equilibrium vegetation distribution under historical conditions and across a wide gradient of future temperature changes to look for consistencies and trends among the many future scenarios, (b) simulate time-dependent changes in vegetation distribution and its associated C pools to illustrate the possible trajectories of vegetation change near the high and low ends of the temperature gradient, and (c) analyze the extent of the US area supporting a negative C balance. Both models agree that a moderate increase in temperature produces an increase in vegetation density and carbon sequestration across most of the US with small changes in vegetation types. Large increases in temperature cause losses of C with large shifts in vegetation types. In the western states, particularly southern California, precipitation and thus vegetation density increase and forests expand under all but the hottest scenarios. In the eastern US, particularly the Southeast, forests expand under the more moderate scenarios but decline under more severe climate scenarios, with catastrophic fires potentially causing rapid vegetation conversions from forest to savanna. Both models show that there is a potential for either positive or negative feedbacks to the atmosphere depending on the level of warming in the climate change scenarios.},

Some are concerned that recent high-severity patch sizes are uncharacteristically large and damaging in dry western forests (Stephens et al. 2013, Ful{\'{e}} et al. 2014). 
--- And Malcom North said that the amount of high severity is similar to the historical amount, but that it's relative proportion has changed.

abstract = {Reference ecological conditions offer important context for land managers as they assess the condition of their landscapes and provide benchmarks for desired future conditions. State-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) are commonly used to estimate reference conditions that can be used to evaluate current ecosystem conditions and to guide land management decisions and activities. The LANDFIRE program created more than 1,000 STSMs and used them to assess departure from a mean reference value for ecosystems in the United States. While the mean provides a useful benchmark, land managers and researchers are often interested in the range of variability around the mean. This range, frequently referred to as the historical range of variability (HRV), offers model users improved understanding of ecosystem function, more information with which to evaluate ecosystem change and potentially greater flexibility in management options. We developed a method for using LANDFIRE STSMs to estimate the HRV around the mean reference condition for each model state in ecosystems by varying the fire probabilities. The approach is flexible and can be adapted for use in a variety of ecosystems. HRV analysis can be combined with other information to help guide complex land management decisions.},

abstract = {The influence of substrate on long-term vegetation dynamics has received little attention, and yet nutrient-limited ecosystems have some of the highest levels of endemism in the world. The diverse geology of the Klamath Mountains of northern California (USA) allows examination of the long-term influence of edaphic constraints in subalpine forests through a comparison of vegetation histories between nutrient-limited ultramafic substrates and terrain that is more fertile. Pollen and charcoal records spanning up to 15000 years from ultramafic settings reveal a distinctly different vegetation history compared to other soil types. In non-ultramafic settings, the dominant trees and shrubs shifted in elevation in response to Holocene climate variations resulting in compositional and structural changes, whereas on ultramafic substrates changes were primarily structural, not compositional. Fire activity was similar through most of the Holocene with the exception of declines over the last 4000 years on ultramafic substrates, likely due to the reduction of understory fuels and cooler wetter conditions than in the middle Holocene. These results suggest that the tree and shrub distributions were more responsive to past climate changes on non-ultramafic substrates compared to those on ultramafic substrates. The combination of these dynamics may help explain high levels of plant diversity in the Klamath Mountains and provide insights for managing these complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {The complexity inherent in variable, or mixed-severity fire regimes makes quantitative char- acterization of important fire regime attributes (e.g., proportion of landscape burned at different severities, size and distribution of stand-replacing patches) difficult. As a result, there is ambiguity associated with the term ‘mixed-severity’. We address this ambiguity through spatial analysis of two recent wildland fires in upper elevation mixed-conifer forests that occurred in an area with over 30 years of relatively freely-burning natural fires. We take advantage of robust estimates of fire severity and detailed spatial datasets to investigate patterns and controls on stand-replacing patches within these fires. Stand-replacing patches made up 15{\%} of the total burned area between the two fires, which consisted of many small patches (<4 ha) and few large patches (>60 ha). Smaller stand-replacing patches were generally associated with shrub-dominated (Arctostaphylos spp. and Ceanothus spp.) and pine-dominated vegetation types, while larger stand-replacing patches tended to occur in more shade-tolerant, fir-dominated types. Additionally, in shrub-dominated types stand- replacing patches were often constrained to the underlying patch of vegetation, which for the shrub type were smaller across the two fire areas than vegetation patches for all other dominant vegetation types. For white and red fir forest types we found little evidence of vegetation patch constraint on the extent of stand-replacing patches. The patch dynamics we identified can be used to inform management strategies for landscapes in similar forest types.},

abstract = {Global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts in the twenty-first century, but the relative contributions from changes in moisture supply (precipitation) versus evaporative demand (potential evapotranspiration; PET) have not been comprehensively assessed. Using output from a suite of general circulation model (GCM) simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, projected twenty-first century drying and wetting trends are investigated using two offline indices of surface moisture balance: the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). PDSI and SPEI projections using precipitation and Penman-Monteith based PET changes from the GCMs generally agree, showing robust cross-model drying in western North America, Central America, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the Amazon and robust wetting occurring in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and east Africa (PDSI only). The SPEI is more sensitive to PET changes than the PDSI, especially in arid regions such as the Sahara and Middle East. Regional drying and wetting patterns largely mirror the spatially heterogeneous response of precipitation in the models, although drying in the PDSI and SPEI calculations extends beyond the regions of reduced precipitation. This expansion of drying areas is attributed to globally widespread increases in PET, caused by increases in surface net radiation and the vapor pressure deficit. Increased PET not only intensifies drying in areas where precipitation is already reduced, it also drives areas into drought that would otherwise experience little drying or even wetting from precipitation trends alone. This PET amplification effect is largest in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, and is especially pronounced in western North America, Europe, and southeast China. Compared to PDSI projections using precipitation changes only, the projections incorporating both precipitation and PET changes increase the percentage of global land area projected to experience at least moderate drying (PDSI standard deviation of ≤-1) by the end of the twenty-first century from 12 to 30 {\%}. PET induced moderate drying is even more severe in the SPEI projections (SPEI standard deviation of ≤-1; 11 to 44 {\%}), although this is likely less meaningful because much of the PET induced drying in the SPEI occurs in the aforementioned arid regions. Integrated accounting of both the supply and demand sides of the surface moisture balance is therefore critical for characterizing the full range of projected drought risks tied to increasing greenhouse gases and associated warming of the climate system. © 2014 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).},

abstract = {Historical range of variability has been proposed as a concept that can be used by forest land managers to guide conservation of ecosystem functions and biodiversity conservation. The role of humans in historical range of variability has remained somewhat murky and unsettled, even though it is clear that humans have been, are, and will continue to be forces of disturbance and recovery in forested landscapes. We attempt to develop concepts that integrate the ecological and social forces affecting landscape variability. Toward that end, we present a conceptual framework that places "range of variability" into a broader context and integrates the ecological and social forces affecting landscapes past, present, and future. We use two terms to aid us in understanding the utility of historical range of variability as a context and future range of variability as a point of comparison: (1) the ecological range of variability is the estimated range of some ecological condition as a function of the biophysical and social forces affecting the area and (2) the social range of variability is the range of an ecological condition that society finds acceptable at a given time. We find it is important to recognize that future range of variability represents a constantly emerging and changing set of conditions, and that the more humans push a system to depart from its historical range of variabiloity domain, the less likely it becomes that historical range of variability processes will prove useful as benchmarks in recovering a system.},

abstract = {Forest managers need a comprehensive scientific understanding of natural stand development processes when designing silvicultural systems that integrate ecological and economic objectives, including a better appreciation of the nature of disturbance regimes and the biological legacies, such as live trees, snags, and logs, that they leave behind. Most conceptual forest development models do not incorporate current knowledge of the: (1) complexity of structures (including spatial patterns) and developmental processes; (2) duration of development in long-lived forests; (3) complex spatial patterns of stands that develop in later stages of seres; and particularly (4) the role of disturbances in creating structural legacies that become key elements of the post-disturbance stands, We elaborate on existing models for stand structural development using natural stand development of the Douglas-fir-western hemlock sere in the Pacific Northwest as our primary example; most of the principles are broadly applicable while some processes (e.g. role of epicormic branches) are related to specific species. We discuss the use of principles from disturbance ecology and natural stand development to create silvicultural approaches that are more aligned with natural processes. Such approaches provide for a greater abundance of standing dead and down wood and large old trees, perhaps reducing short-term commercial productivity but ultimately enhancing wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, including soil protection and nutrient retention.

abstract = {Forest restoration guided by historical reference conditions of fire regime, forest structure, and composition has been increasingly and successfully applied in fire-adapted forests of western North America. But because climate change is expected to alter vegetation distributions and foster severe disturbances, does it make sense to restore the ecological role of wildland fire through management burning and related activities such as tree thinning? I suggest that some site- and date-specific historical conditions may be less relevant, but reference conditions in the broad sense are still useful. Reference conditions encompass not only the recent past but also evolutionary history, reflecting the role of fire as a selective force over millennia. Taking a long-term functional view of historical reference conditions as the result of evolutionary processes can provide insights into past forest adaptations and migrations under various climates. As future climates change, historical reference data from lower, southerly, and drier sites may be useful in places that are higher, northerly, and currently wetter. Almost all models suggest that the future will have substantial increases in wildfire occurrence, but prior to recent human-caused fire exclusion, fire-adapted pine forests of western North America were among the most frequently burned in the world. Restoration of patterns of burning and fuels/forest structure that reasonably emulate historical conditions prior to fire exclusion is consistent with reducing the susceptibility of these ecosystems to catastrophic loss. Priorities may include fire and thinning treatments of upper elevation ecotones to facilitate forest migration, whereas vulnerable low-elevation forests may merit less management investment.},

annote = {Things I can say and cite this paper
The importance of fires to the landscape ecology of western forests has been well documented.

For the drier forest types within this landscape, frequent fires (usually having low mortality) were the norm. After large-scale fire suppression became the norm in the second half of the 19th century, less fire-tolerant species (such as Douglas fir and white fir) have come to dominate areas where they were once a minor part of the vegetation community.

Grazing and development made fires less common by altering or removing the fine fuels that carried fire. Timber harvest, especially of fire-tolerant species such as ponderosa and sugar pines, accelerated the increased cover of species such as white fir. Finally, fire suppression allowed the buildup of medium size fuels and ladder fuels, which promotes larger and hotter fires when they do occur. Moreover, the lack of natural fires has meant that variation in fuel loading has decreased, which allows large fires to spread over very large areas.

Then note that concern about this has led to studies of fire departure and cite hugh's frid work.

This paper may also be useful for management implications!},

abstract = {Many scientists and forest land managers concur that past fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting practices have created unnatural and unhealthy conditions in the dry, ponderosa pine forests of the western United States. Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience fires that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe fires we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely "unnatural" or "unhealthy." Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These findings highlight the fact that severe fire provides an important ecological backdrop for fire specialists like the Black-backed Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe fire may be much broader than commonly appreciated.},

abstract = {This paper examines the past, present, and future use of the concept of historical range and variability (HRV) in land management. The history, central concepts, benefits, and limitations of HRV are presented along with a discussion on the value of HRV in a changing world with rapid climate warming, exotic species invasions, and increased land development. This paper is meant as a reference on the strengths and limitations of applying HRV in land management. Applications of the HRV concept have specific contexts, constraints, and conditions that are relevant to any application and are influential to the extent to which the concept is applied. These conditions notwithstanding, we suggest that the HRV concept offers an objective reference for many applications, and it still offers a comprehensive reference for the short-term and possible long-term management of our nation's landscapes until advances in technology and ecological research provide more suitable and viable approaches in theory and application.},

abstract = {Quantifying the historical range and variability of landscape composition and structure using simulation modeling is becoming an important means of assessing current landscape condition and prioritizing landscapes for ecosystem restoration. However, most simulated time series are generated using static climate conditions which fail to account for the predicted major changes in future climate. This paper presents a simulation study that generates reference landscape compositions for all combinations of three climate scenarios (warm-wet, hot-dry, and current) and three fire regime scenarios (half historical, historical, and double historical fire frequencies) to determine if future climate change has an effect on landscape dynamics. We applied the spatially explicit, state-and-transition, landscape fire succession model LANDSUM to two large landscapes in west-central Montana, USA. LANDSUM was parameterized and initialized using spatial data generated from the LANDFIRE prototype project. Biophysical settings, critical spatial inputs to LANDSUM, were empirically modeled across the landscape using environmental gradients created from historical and modeled future climate daily weather data summaries. Successional pathways and disturbance probabilities were assigned to these biophysical settings based on existing field data and extensive literature reviews. To assess the impact of changes in climate and fire regime, we compared simulated area burned and landscape composition over time among the different simulation scenario combinations using response variables of Sorenson's index (a global measure of similarity) and area occupied by the dominant vegetation class (simple indicator of change in landscape composition). Results show that simulated time series using future predicted climate scenarios are significantly different from the simulated historical time series and any changes in the fire regime tend to create more dissimilar and more variable simulated time series. Our study results indicate that historical time series should be used in conjunction with simulated future time series as references for managing landscapes.},

abstract = {Landscape patterns in the northwestern United States are mostly shaped by the interaction of fire and succession, and conversely, vegetation patterns influence fire dynamics and plant colonization processes. Historical landscape pattern dynamics can be used by resource managers to assess current landscape conditions and develop target spatial characteristics for management activities. The historical range and variability (HRV) of landscape pattern can be quantified from simulated chronosequences of landscape vegetation maps and can be used to (1) describe temporal variation in patch statistics, (2) develop limits of acceptable change, and (3) design landscape treatment guidelines for ecosystem management. Although this simulation approach has many advantages, the limitations of this method have not been explored in detail. To demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, we performed several simulation experiments using the spatially explicit, multiple pathway model a LANDscape Succession Model (LANDSUM) to quantify the range and variability in six class and landscape pattern metrics for four landscapes in the northwestern United States. First, we applied the model to spatially nested landscapes to evaluate the effect of landscape size on the HRV pattern metrics. Next, we averaged the HRV pattern metrics across maps generated from simulation time spans of 100, 500, and 1000 years and intervals 5, 10, 25 and 50 years to assess optimal output generation parameters. We then altered the elevation data layer to evaluate effect of topography on pattern metrics, and cut various shapes (circle, rectangle, square) from a landscape to examine landscape shape and orientation influences. Then, we altered the input vegetation maps to assess the influence of initial conditions on landscape metrics output. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of input fire probabilities and transition times was performed. Results indicate landscapes should be quite large to realistically simulation fire pattern. Landscape shape, and orientation are critically important to quantifying patch metrics. Simulation output need only be stored every 20-50 years but landscapes should be simulated for long time periods (??? 1000 years). All landscapes are unique So conclusions generated here may not be entirely applicable to all western US landscapes. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Fire's ecological role in the Sierra Nevada, especially within the forests, has been well documented by many researchers. Historically, and in particular prior to large-scale European alterations to these forests, frequent fires with primarily low mortality impacts burned across large areas, reducing fuels and creating uneven-aged stands. Consequently, crown fires resulting in high mortality were often a few hundred acres at most. 

It is perhaps in this regard that the current Sierran forest differs most dramatically from the present condition, in which very large areas with over 70{\%} canopy mortality have been observed (e.g., the Rim Fire of 2013, {\&}lt;list more{\&}gt;).

See other Kilgore paper (1971b) for a note on red fir not being as influenced by fire - could help explain why it is less departed, if that's the case.

The shrubs and herbaceous plants that grow after low intensity fire are forage or cover for a number of mammals and birds.},

abstract = {In many forests of the western US, increased potential for fires of uncharacteristic intensity and severity is frequently attributed to structural changes brought about by fire exclusion, past land management practices, and climate. Extent of forest change and effect on understory vegetation over time are not well understood, but such information is useful to forest management focused on restoring biodiversity and resilience to these ecosystems. We re-measured three large (4ha) historical "Methods of Cutting" (MC) plots in mixed-conifer forest of the central Sierra Nevada installed in 1929 to evaluate the effects of different logging methods. Trees ???10cm were surveyed across the entire plots and understory vegetation (tree seedlings, shrubs, and herbaceous species) was quantified within quadrats in the old-growth condition in 1929 prior to logging, later in 1929 after logging, and again in 2007 or 2008. We also compared forest structure in the MC plots with an adjacent unlogged "control" area and collected fire scar samples from nearby stumps to evaluate the historical fire regime. The contemporary tree density in the MC plots (739treesha-1) was 2.4times greater than the 1929 pre-logging density (314treesha-1). Trees in the small and intermediate size classes (10-75cmdbh) were significantly over-represented, and trees in the larger size classes (>90cmdbh) generally significantly under-represented, compared with historical conditions. The proportion of pine dropped from 37{\%} of tree basal area in 1929 to 21{\%} in 2007/08. Density of small to intermediate sized trees was similar in the contemporary logged and unlogged control plots, suggesting that over the long term, ingrowth may have been influenced more by lack of fire than historical logging. Change to non-tree vegetation was most pronounced for shrub cover, which averaged 28.6{\%} in 1929 but only 2.5{\%} in 2008. CART analysis indicated that the highest shrub cover in 1929 was in areas having four or fewer trees growing within 15m to the south of the quadrat, suggesting that reduced light was the most likely explanation for the decline over time. Herbaceous species richness in 2008 was significantly lower than in 1931, two years after logging, but did not differ significantly from 1929, prior to logging. Understory vegetation should benefit from thinning or prescribed fire treatments that lead to a greater abundance of higher light environments within stands. ?? 2013.},

Fire frequency and fire cycle can be defined in point-based and area-based ways, and the analytical results indicate that the different definitions are interrelated with each other, except the fire number-based fire frequency definition. The point-based definitions can be seen as special cases of area-based definitions when area is reduced to a single site. The generation of an ideal historical fire data set allowed a comparison among different methods of estimating fire frequency and fire cycle in terms of associated bias. An over-estimate of fire cycle could be generally expected by using stand-origin maps, and recent fire history could influence the estimate significantly. The number of fire maps required to obtain a relatively stable fire cycle estimate is also influenced by fire history. Point-based data obtained from random and systematic sampling designs displayed almost equally good fire cycle estimates for the tested data set, when the sample sizes relative to the total number of possible sample units are large. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Developing appropriate management options for adapting to climate change is a new challenge for land managers, and integration of climate change concepts into operational management and planning on United States national forests is just starting. We established science-management partnerships on the Olympic National Forest (Washington) and Tahoe National Forest (California) in the first effort to develop adaptation options for specific national forests. We employed a focus group process in order to establish the scientific context necessary for understanding climate change and its anticipated effects, and to develop specific options for adapting to a warmer climate. Climate change scientists provided the scientific knowledge base on which adaptations could be based, and resource managers developed adaptation options based on their understanding of ecosystem structure, function, and management. General adaptation strategies developed by national forest managers include: (1) reduce vulnerability to anticipated climate-induced stress by increasing resilience at large spatial scales, (2) consider tradeoffs and conflicts that may affect adaptation success, (3) manage for realistic outcomes and prioritize treatments that facilitate adaptation to a warmer climate, (4) manage dynamically and experimentally, and (5) manage for structure and composition. Specific adaptation options include: (1) increase landscape diversity, (2) maintain biological diversity, (3) implement early detection/rapid response for exotic species and undesirable resource conditions, (4) treat large-scale disturbance as a management opportunity and integrate it in planning, (5) implement treatments that confer resilience at large spatial scales, (6) match engineering of infrastructure to expected future conditions, (7) promote education and awareness about climate change among resource staff and local publics, and (8) collaborate with a variety of partners on adaptation strategies and to promote ecoregional management. The process described here can quickly elicit a large amount of information relevant for adaptation to climate change, and can be emulated for other national forests, groups of national forests with similar resources, and other public lands. As adaptation options are iteratively generated for additional administrative units on public lands, management options can be compared, tested, and integrated into adaptive management. Science-based adaptation is imperative because increasing certainty about climate impacts and management outcomes may take decades.},

abstract = {The 2013 Rim Fire, originating on Forest Service land, burned into old-growth forests within Yosemite National Park with relatively restored frequent-fire regimes (≥2 predominantly low and moderate severity burns within the last 35. years). Forest structure and fuels data were collected in the field 3-4. years before the fire, providing a rare chance to use pre-existing plot data to analyze fire effects. We used regression tree and random forests analysis to examine the influence of forest structure, fuel, fire history, topographic and weather conditions on observed fire severity in the Rim Fire, as estimated from an initial fire severity assessment based on the relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR). Plots that burned on days with strong plume activity experienced moderate- to high-severity fire effects regardless of forest conditions, fire history or topography. Fire severity was also highly negatively associated with elevation, with lower severity observed in plots over 1700. m. Burning index (a composite index of fire weather), time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity. Plots that had experienced fire within the last 14. years burned mainly at low severity in the Rim Fire, while plots that exceeded that time since last fire tended to burn at moderate or high severity. This effect of time since last fire was even more pronounced on days when the burning index was high. Our results suggest that wildfire burning under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, can produce large areas of high-severity fire even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes. © 2014.},
annote = {Cite this for: mention that we are currently observing more high severity fire and larger patches of high severiy fire than in the past

Some studies link large fires with attributes of climate change measured by the PDSI, such as increasing drought severity and increased temperature

Cites Marlon et al 2012 and Stephens et al 2014 that big severe fires may be common in future.

Importance of low severity fire: created and maintained spatial heterogeneity including different developmental stages and canopy closures over large areas, but also structural complexity at the fine scale. 

National parks in the Sierra are the only places where natural fires have been mostly allowed to learn, since the 1960s or so.

There is a legacy of increased tree density from the fire suppression years that may impact the resilience of forests under extreme conditions, such as extreme drought or extreme weather events that happen concurrently with wildfires.

Seems like they found that in the absence of frequent fire, severity is stronly linked to the burning index. So frequent burning inures patches somewhat to weather vagaries.

High severity happened under extreme fire and fire weather, regardless of past fuel treatments or burns. Implication is that fuels treatments will not stop extreme fires. But, they will stop/affect fires not occuring under extreme weather, which is most of them.

@article{Miller2009,
abstract = {Multispectral satellite data have become a common tool used in the mapping of wildland fire effects. Fire severity, defined as the degree to which a site has been altered, is often the variable mapped. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) used in an absolute difference change detection protocol (dNBR), has become the remote sensing method of choice for US Federal land management agencies to map fire severity due to wildland fire. However, absolute differenced vegetation indices are correlated to the pre-fire chlorophyll content of the vegetation occurring within the fire perimeter. Normalizing dNBR to produce a relativized dNBR (RdNBR) removes the biasing effect of the pre-fire condition. Employing RdNBR hypothetically allows creating categorical classifications using the same thresholds for fires occurring in similar vegetation types without acquiring additional calibration field data on each fire. In this paper we tested this hypothesis by developing thresholds on random training datasets, and then comparing accuracies for (1) fires that occurred within the same geographic region as the training dataset and in similar vegetation, and (2) fires from a different geographic region that is climatically and floristically similar to the training dataset region but supports more complex vegetation structure. We additionally compared map accuracies for three measures of fire severity: the composite burn index (CBI), percent change in tree canopy cover, and percent change in tree basal area. User's and producer's accuracies were highest for the most severe categories, ranging from 70.7{\%} to 89.1{\%}. Accuracies of the moderate fire severity category for measures describing effects only to trees (percent change in canopy cover and basal area) indicated that the classifications were generally not much better than random. Accuracies of the moderate category for the CBI classifications were somewhat better, averaging in the 50{\%}-60{\%} range. These results underscore the difficulty in isolating fire effects to individual vegetation strata when fire effects are mixed. We conclude that the models presented here and in Miller and Thode ([Miller, J.D. {\&} Thode, A.E., (2007). Quantifying burn severity in a heterogeneous landscape with a relative version of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Remote Sensing of Environment, 109, 66-80.]) can produce fire severity classifications (using either CBI, or percent change in canopy cover or basal area) that are of similar accuracy in fires not used in the original calibration process, at least in conifer dominated vegetation types in Mediterranean-climate California.},

@article{Miller2012,
abstract = {Data from recent assessments indicate that the annual area of wildfires burning at high severity (where most trees are killed) has increased since 1984 across much of the southwestern United States. Increasing areas of high-severity fire can occur when greater area is burned at constant proportion of high-severity fire, or when the proportion of high-severity fire within fire perimeters increases, or some combination of both. For the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA) area, which includes forestlands in eastern California and western Nevada, Miller et al. (2009a) concluded that the proportion of area burning at high severity in mixed-conifer forests had risen over the 1984 to 2004 period. However, no statistical assessment was made of the temporal trend in high-severity fire area because the analyzed dataset was incomplete in the early years of the study period. In this update, we use satellite-derived estimates of fire severity from the three most widely distributed SNFPA forest types to examine the trend in percent high severity and highseverity fire area for all wildfires ≥80 ha that occurred during the 1984 to 2010 period. Time-series regression modeling indicates that the percentage of total high severity per year for a combination of yellow pine (ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa Lawson {\&} C. Lawson] or Jeffrey pine [P. jeffreyi Balf.]) and mixed-conifer forests increased significantly over the 27-year period. The annual area of high-severity fire also increased significantly in yellow pine-mixed-conifer forests. The percentage of high severity in fires ≥400 ha burning in yellow pine-mixed-conifer forests was significantly higher than in fires <400 ha. Additionally, the number of fires ≥400 ha significantly increased over the 1950 to 2010 period. There were no significant trends in red fir (Abies magnifica A. Murray bis) forests. These results confirm and expand our earlier published results for a shorter 21-year period.},

abstract = {Aim This study appraises historical fire regimes for Californian mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra San Pedro Martir (SSPM). The SSPM represents the last remaining mixed- conifer forest along the Pacific coast still subject to uncontrolled, periodic ground fire. Location The SSPM is a north-south trending fault bound range, centred on 31°N latitude, 100 km SE of Ensenada, Baja California. Methods We surveyed forests for composition, population structure, and historical dynamics both spatially and temporally over the past 65 years using repeat aerial photo- graphs and ground sampling. Fire perimeter history was reconstructed based on time- series aerial photographs dating from 1942 to 1991 and interpretable back to 1925. A total of 256 1-ha sites randomly selected from aerial photographs were examined along a chronosequence for density and cover of canopy trees, density of snags and downed logs, and cover of non-conifer trees and shrubs. Twenty-four stands were sampled on- the-ground by a point-centred quarter method which yielded data on tree density, basal area, frequency, importance value, and shrub and herb cover. Results Forests experience moderately intense understory fires that range in size to 6400 ha, as well as numerous smaller, low intensity burns with low cumulative spatial extent. SSPM forests average 2545{\%} cover and 65-145 trees per ha. Sapling densities were two to three times that of overstory trees. Size-age distributions of trees 2 4 cm dbh indicate multi-age stands with steady-state dynamics. Stands are similar to Californian mixed conifer forests prior to the imposition of fire suppression policy. Livestock grazing does not appear to be suppressing conifer regeneration. Main conclusions Our spatially-based reconstruction shows the open forest structure in SSPM to be a product of infrequent, intense surface fires with fire rotation periods of 52 years, rather than frequent, low intensity fires at intervals of 4-20 years proposed from California fire-scar dendrochronology (FSD) studies. Ground fires in SSPM were intense enough to kill pole-size trees and a significant number of overstory trees. We attribute long fire intervals to the gradual build-up of subcontinuous shrub cover, conifer recruit- ment and litter accumulation. Differences from photo interpretation and FSD estimates are due to assumptions made with respect to site-based (point) sampling of fire, and nonfractal fire intensities along fire size frequency distributions. Fire return intervals determined by FSD give undue importance to local burns which collectively use up little fuel, cover little area, and have little demographic impact on forests.},

Within this region, the forested environment including the physiographic setting, geology, soils, and vegetation is described in detail. A simulation model is presented for this portion of the Sierra Nevada that refines discussions of climate, and disturbance regimes are described to illustrate the interaction between these features of the environment and vegetation in the study area. In the classification, plant associations are differentiated by floristic composition, environmental setting, and measurements of productivity. Differences in elevation, aspect, topographic setting, and soil properties generally distinguish each plant association described. A detailed description is presented for each plant association, including a discussion of the distribution, environment, vegetation, soils, productivity, coarse woody debris, range, wildlife, and management recommendations. A complete species list and tables for cross referencing specific characteristics of each association are provided},

abstract = {A bioclimate model predicting the presence or absence of aspen, Populus tremuloides, in western USA from climate variables was developed by using the Random Forests classification tree on Forest Inventory data from about 118,000 permanent sample plots. A reasonably parsimonious model used eight predictors to describe aspen’s climate profile. Classification errors averaged 4.5{\%}, most of which were errors of commission. Themodel was driven primarily by three variables: an annual dryness index, the ratio of summer to annual precipitation, and an interaction of growing season precipitation with the summer–winter temperature differential. Projecting the contemporary climate profile into the future climate provided by three General Circulation Models and two scenarios (SRES A2 and either B1 or B2) suggested that the area occupied by the profile should diminish rapidly over the course of the century, 6– 41{\%} by the decade surrounding 2030, 40–75{\%} for that surrounding 2060, and 46–94{\%} for 2090. The relevance of the climate profile to understanding climate-based responses is illustrated by relating trends in climate to the recent incidence of sudden aspen dieback that has plagued portions of the aspen distribution. Of the eight variables in the profile, four reached extreme values during 2000–2003, the period immediately preceding the appearance of damage in aerial surveys.},

abstract = {Fire contributes to the maintenance of species diversity in many plant com- munities, but few studies have compared its impacts in similar communities that vary in such attributes as soils and productivity.We compared how a wildfire affected plant diversity in chaparral vegetation on serpentine and sandstone soils. We hypothesized that because biomass and cover are lower in serpentine chaparral, space and light are less limiting, and therefore postfire increases in plant species diversity would be lower than in sandstone chaparral. In 40 pairs of burned and unburned 250-m2 plots, we measured changes in the plant community after a fire for three years. The diversity of native and exotic species increased more in response to fire in sandstone than serpentine chaparral, at both the local (plot) and regional (whole study) scales. In serpentine compared with sandstone chaparral, specialized fire-dependent species were less prevalent, mean fire severity was lower, mean time since last fire was longer, postfire shrub recruitment was lower, and regrowth of biomass was slower. Within each chaparral type, the responses of diversity to fire were positively correlated with prefire shrub cover and with a number of measures of soil fertility. Fire severity was negatively related to the postfire change in diversity in sandstone chaparral, and unimodally related to the postfire change in diversity in serpentine chaparral. Our results suggest that the effects of fire on less productive plant communities like serpentine chaparral may be less pronounced, although longer lasting, than the effects of fire on similar but more productive communities.},

abstract = {Wildfire behavior can be modified by altering the quantity, structure, and arrangement of fuel (flammable vegetation) by silvicultural treatments such as forest thinning and prescribed burning. The type and arrangement (including landscape location) of treated areas have been demonstrated to influence wildfire behavior. This study analyzes the response of several key fire behavior variables to variation in the type, amount, and spatial arrangement of fuel treatments for simulated wildfires in mixed-conifer forests of the southern Cascades in the Goosenest Adaptive Management Area (GAMA). NEXUS and BehavePlus were used to simulate pre- and post-treatment stand-level fire behavior. Fire area simulator (FARSITE) was used to simulate landscape-level wildfire behavior in both untreated and treated forest landscapes. In the forest landscape, treatment areas were placed in the landscape according to two strategically designed arrangements and one random treatment arrangement. Treatments included thinning by prescribed burning (burn-only), mechanical thinning (mechanical-only), mechanical thinning followed by burning (mechanical-burn), and no treatment (control). At the stand level, the mechanical-burn treatment most effectively reduced both surface fire (e.g., decreased flame length) and crown fire behavior (e.g., torching index). At the landscape level, treatment type, amount, and arrangement had important effects on both fire spread and fire intensity. In this landscape the most effective treatment arrangement was Finney's optimal SPLATs design. This study shows that there is potential to efficiently reduce high-intensity fire behavior while treating less area by relying on strategically placed treatments.},

Fire was prevalent enough during the historical period of this study that much of the Sierran vegetation possesses some degree of fire adaptation. Extensive research on fire regimes of the Sierra Nevada has been done, especially on the middle elevation mixed conifer types. 

As Skinner and Chang (1994) acknowledge, detailed fire history and fire regime data from studies within the northern Sierra Nevada are uncommon. Researchers have been forced to make inferences based on the southern Sierras, the Klamath mountains, and the southern Cascades. For this reason a simulation study of the northern Sierra is appropriate and will provide a basis to evaluate current assumptions about fire regimes of the vegetation types (which are well studied) in the region.},

abstract = {Stands of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) rank among the most biologically diverse plant communities across the intermountain region of western North America. Marked declines of aspen have occurred in recent decades, likely due to a combination of effects from changes in fire regimes, herbivory, climate (e.g. drought), and interspecific competition with conifer species. However, it is poorly understood how the effects of these factors are manifested at a landscape scale over decadal time periods. Analysis of field data combined with topographic information collected across the 500,000 ha Owyhee Plateau in southwestern Idaho revealed that aspen in the area occur in three different biophysical settings; First, aspen stands exist at high altitudes on south-facing slopes where local conifer species are not likely to occur because of limiting temperature or precipitation levels under current climate conditions. In these areas aspen is the potential vegetation type rather than conifers. Second, aspen grow on anomalously wet microsites (e.g. near springs), and third, aspen grow within upland mixed aspen/conifer stands, which are experiencing rapid rates of conifer establishment. Based on a paired t-test (a = 0.05) we conclude that stands growing on wet microsites show significantly slower successional rates of conifer establishment relative to upland aspen stands. We developed a conceptual state-and-transition model for upland aspen/conifer stands occurring across a range of topographic positions. We then parameterized the model using extensive field data in the vegetation dynamics computer simulation model Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT), and examined the current and future aspen distribution under varying fire regimes. Model results indicate that average fire return intervals of 50–70 years are desirable for maintenance of aspen in upland areas where conifers are present. Under the current fire regime in the area many upland aspen/conifer stands will likely be lost within 80–200 years. Thresholds for the effect of conifer encroachment and browsing on aspen regeneration identified through this research are similar to those described by others across the West. Wetherefore suggest that the results presented for theOwyhee Plateau are likely applicable to semi-arid aspen woodlands across the American West where succession to conifers is a cause of aspen decline.},
annote = {Really good article. Has lots of specific numbers with respect to fire intervals, time in successional stages, differences between types of aspen found, impact of conifers, what conifer encroachment does, etc.

I think it brings up an important point for the model, which is, do we include a change away from aspen? I don't think we can because we're not including other possible transitions from one veg type to another. But this is a big issue....it would probably be a better model.},

abstract = {State-and-transition models hold great potential to aid in understanding rangeland ecosystems’ response to natural and/or management-induced disturbances by providing a framework for organizing current understanding of potential ecosystem dynamics. Many conceptual state-and-transition models have been developed, however, the ecological interpretation of the model’s primary components, states, transitions, and thresholds, has varied due to a lack of universally accepted definitions. The lack of consistency in definitions has led to confusion and criticism indicating the need for further development and refinement of the theory and associated models. We present an extensive review of current literature and conceptual models and point out the inconsistencies in the application of nonequilibrium ecology concepts. The importance of ecosystem stability as defined by the resistance and resilience of plant communities to disturbance is discussed as an important concept relative to state-and-transition modeling. Finally, we propose a set of concise definitions for state-and-transition model components and we present a conceptual model of state/transition/threshold relationships that are determined by the resilience and resistance of the ecosystems’ primary ecological processes. This model provides a framework for development of process-based state-and-transition models for management and research.},

{\&}quot;Rather than a direct use of history for prediction, most historical ecologists emphasize the importance of knowing history, because it informs us about what is possible within the context of certain locations and times, and it places current conditions into this context. This knowledge often informs us about the potential causes of change and the historical pathways that brought ecosystems to their current condition (Kaufmann et al. 1994, Morgan et al. 1994, Swanson et al. 1994). 
Because history provides multiple points of temporal reference, it can also tell us if current conditions are highly anomalous and, therefore, in some cases deserving of greater priority in management decisions and actions.{\&}quot;

abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify the influence of interannual and interdecadal climate variation and changes in land use on fire regimes in fire prone mixed conifer forests in the central Sierra Nevada in Yosemite National Park, California. We quantified fire frequency, fire return interval, fire extent, and season of fire for a 400year period using fire-scar dendrochronology. The influence of regional climate variability and land use on fire occurrence and extent was assessed by relating the fire record to regional climate reconstructions and to documentary records of settlement and land use. The timing and extent for fires was related to interannual and interdecadal variation in drought and temperature linked to variation in the Pacific North America Pattern (PNA), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation (NINO) had little effect on fire. The occurrence of large fires was also influenced by interactions among climate patterns and they occurred more often than expected in PNA + NI??O3-years. At interdecadal time scales area burned was positively correlated with temperature and the PNA. Fire occurrence and extent declined with mid-19th century Euro-American settlement and land use change and fire was nearly eliminated after 1900 when a fire exclusion policy was implemented. A two-fold increase in rate of burning in the late 18th and early 19th century corresponds with spread of non-native disease to Native American populations during the Spanish Colonial Period but the PNA was also mainly positive during this period. Fire regimes were sensitive to shifting modes of climate and land use which can lead to variable pathways of forest development and hence forest structure. Forest structure at the time of Euro-American settlement reflects this sensitivity and managers should consider presettlement conditions as only a guide for restoration planning in forests highly altered by fire exclusion under a changing climate. Moreover, considering winter PNA could provide managers with an early indication of conditions during the fire season that are conducive to widespread fire. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Fire exclusion in mixed conifer forests has increased the risk of fire due to decades of fuel accumulation. Restoration of fire into altered forests is a challenge because of a poor understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of fire regimes. In this study the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire regimes and forest age structure are recon- structed in a 2325-ha mixed conifer forest in the Klamath Mountains. Forests were multiaged and burned frequently at low and moderate severity, but forest age structure did not vary with aspect, elevation, or topographic position. Recently there has been an increase in forest density and a forest compositional shift to shade-tolerant species. Median fire return in- tervals (FRI) ranged from 11.5 to 16.5 yr and varied with aspect but not with forest composition or elevation. The median area burned was 106 ha, and the pre-Euro-American fire rotation of 19 yr increased to 238 yr after 1905. Intra-annual position of fire scars in the tree rings indicates that 93{\%} of fires occurred during the dry midsummer through fall period. Spatial patterns of sites with similar fire dates were spatially coherent and separated from others by topographic features that influence fire spread. Thus, patterns of fire oc- currence tended to be fixed in space with timing of fires varying among groups of sites. Spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence suggest that managers using physical fea- tures to contain prescribed fire will create burn patterns consistent with historical fires in the Klamath Mountains.},

Key landscape metrics were calculated at 20-yr$\backslash$nintervals for YNP for the period from 1705-1995. These metrics were used$\backslash$nto first evaluate the relative effects of small vs. large fire events on$\backslash$nlandscape structure and were then compared to similar metrics calculated$\backslash$nfor both pre- and post-harvest landscapes of the TNF. Large fires, such$\backslash$nas those that burned in 1988, produced a structurally different$\backslash$nlandscape than did previous, smaller fires (1705-1985). The total number$\backslash$nof patches of all types was higher after 1988 (694 vs. 340-404 before$\backslash$n1988), and mean patch size was reduced by almost half (186 ha vs.$\backslash$n319-379 ha). The amount of unburned forest was less following the 1988$\backslash$nfires (63{\%} vs. 72-90{\%} prior to 1988), yet the number of unburned$\backslash$npatches increased by nearly an order of magnitude (230 vs. a maximum of$\backslash$n41 prior to 1988). Total core area and mean core area per patch$\backslash$ndecreased after 1988 relative to smaller fires (-73,700 ha vs.$\backslash$n87,000-110,000 ha, and 320 ha vs. 2,123 ha, respectively). Notably, only$\backslash$nedge density was similar (17 m ha(-1) after 1988) to earlier landscapes$\backslash$n(9.8-14.2 m ha(-1)).

2) compare the range of variability in the historical landscape to the current conditions on the Tahoe National Forest

The objectives of this study, discussed in this paper, were to:
3) evaluate the effect of a climate trending towards warmer and dier conditions, as measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) by changing the climate parameter in RMLands while holding other parameters constant
4) consider the management implications for the relationship between the HRV, the FRV, and the current conditions for a range of metrics related to wildfire, seral stage distribution, and patch configuration

abstract = {Disturbance events vary in intensity, size, and frequency, but few opportunities exist to study those that are extreme on more than one of these gradients. This article characterizes successional processes that occur following infrequent disturbance events that are exceptional in their great intensity or large size. The spatial variability in disturbance intensity within large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs) often leads to a heterogeneous pattern of surviving organisms. These surviving organisms dictate much of the initial successional pattern on large disturbances where the opportunities for seeds to disperse into the middle of the disturbance are limited. The traditional distinction between primary and secondary succession is insufficient to capture the tremendous variability in succession following LIDs. Disturbance size influences succession where long-distance colonization by propagules is important. Observations from LIDs suggest the following interrelated hypotheses about trends in succession with increasing distance from seed sources when disturbance intensity is high: (a) initial densities of organisms will be lower; (b) nucleation processes, in which recovering patches serve as foci for additional colonization and expand spatially, will be more important; (c) competitive sorting will be less important relative to chance arrival in determination of community composition, and (d) community composition will be initially less predictable; and (e) the rate of recovery of community composition will be slower. Prediction of succession following LIDs without considering contingencies such as the abundance, types, and spatial distribution of residuals, and distance to seed sources is likely to be unsuccessful for large portions of the landscape. Abundance and spatial arrangement of survivors and arrival patterns of propagules may be the pivotal factors determining how succession differs between intense disturbances of large and small extent.},

abstract = {There has been widespread interest in applying new forest practices based on concepts presented in U.S. Forest Service General Technical Report PSW-GTR-220, “An Ecosystem Management Strategy for Sierran Mixed-Conifer Forests.” This collection of papers (PSW-GTR-237) summarizes the state of the science in some topics relevant to this forest management approach, presents case studies of collaborative planning efforts and field implementation of these new practices, and clarifies some of the concepts presented in GTR 220. It also describes a method for assessing forest heterogeneity at the stand level using the Forest Vegetation Simulator and a new geographic information system tool for project- level planning that classifies a landscape into different topographic categories. While this collection of papers presents information and applications relevant to implementation, it does not offer standards and prescriptions. Forest management should be flexible to adapt to local forest conditions and stakeholder interests. This report does, however, strive to clarify concepts and present examples that may improve communication with stakeholders and help build common ground for collaborative forest management.},

Because the Sierra Nevada is warming, it prompts the question of how that will cause shifts in the fire regime and subsequently landscape structure and configuration.

Climate change scenarios are not available at scales as small as the reference landscape. However, {\&}lt;some people{\&}gt; calculated PDSI globally using X runs of Y climate models. Local experts determined that models CCSM and ESM2M were most appropriate for use in the northern Sierra Nevada. We used PDSI point data from the same geographic extent as for the HRV study (Mallek, unpublished thesis) as a proxy for climate. {\&}lt;at some point will need to discuss the PDSI).

This study by Safford et al is focused on California and the Sierra Nevada as a whole. Since the northern Sierra is not as well studied, the overall conclusions may only apply indirectly. Our study offers a direct look at the influence of future climate trajectories on the study landscape.

Chapter on marten and fisher could be useful for management recommendations.},

abstract = {Wildfire risks for California under four climatic change scenarios were statistically modeled as functions of climate, hydrology, and topography. Wildfire risks for the GFDL and PCM global climate models and the A2 and B1 emissions scenarios were compared for 2005-2034, 2035-2064, and 2070-2099 against a modeled 1961-1990 reference period in California and neighboring states. Outcomes for the GFDL model runs, which exhibit higher temperatures than the PCM model runs, diverged sharply for different kinds of fire regimes, with increased temperatures promoting greater large fire frequency in wetter, forested areas, via the effects of warmer temperatures on fuel flammability. At the same time, reduced moisture availability due to lower precipitation and higher temperatures led to reduced fire risks in some locations where fuel flammability may be less important than the availability of fine fuels. Property damages due to wildfires were also modeled using the 2000 U.S. Census to describe the location and density of residential structures. In this analysis the largest changes in property damages under the climate change scenarios occurred in wildland/urban interfaces proximate to major metropolitan areas in coastal southern California, the Bay Area, and in the Sierra foothills northeast of Sacramento.},

abstract = {Climate change is likely to alter wildfire regimes, but the magnitude and timing of potential climate-driven changes in regional fire regimes are not well understood. We considered how the occurrence, size, and spatial location of large fires might respond to climate projections in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem (GYE) (Wyoming), a large wildland ecosystem dominated by conifer forests and characterized by infrequent, high-severity fire. We developed a suite of statistical models that related monthly climate data (1972-1999) to the occurrence and size of fires >200 ha in the northern Rocky Mountains; these models were cross-validated and then used with downscaled (∼12 km × 12 km) climate projections from three global climate models to predict fire occurrence and area burned in the GYE through 2099. All models predicted substantial increases in fire by midcentury, with fire rotation (the time to burn an area equal to the landscape area) reduced to <30 y from the historical 100-300 y for most of the GYE. Years without large fires were common historically but are expected to become rare as annual area burned and the frequency of regionally synchronous fires increase. Our findings suggest a shift to novel fire-climate-vegetation relationships in Greater Yellowstone by midcentury because fire frequency and extent would be inconsistent with persistence of the current suite of conifer species. The predicted new fire regime would transform the flora, fauna, and ecosystem processes in this landscape and may indicate similar changes for other subalpine forests.},
