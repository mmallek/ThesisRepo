\begin{abstract}
In California's northern Sierra Nevada mountains, the historical processes of fire-dependent forest ecosystems have been interrupted and altered by changing human land use and fire suppression policies. In directing units to plan for a future that includes multiple use and restoration of resilient ecosystems, Forest Service policy directs land managers to explore the range of variability of ecological processes at multiple scales, and to use the results as a tool in restoration and planning. Climate also underlies and influences ecosystem processes related to wildfires and forest succession. Current trends in the northern Sierra are of increasing temperatures, increased precipitation, and earlier snowmelt, as well as changes to the frequency and duration of drought. These climate changes have and continue to influence fire frequency, extent, and severity.

For this thesis, the project partners and I adapted the Rocky Mountain Landscape Simulator (\textsc{RMLands}), a spatially explicit, stochastic, landscape disturbance and succession model, for use in the Sierra Nevada. \textsc{RMLands} was used to simulate wildfires and vegetation dynamics on a portion of the Tahoe National Forest in California, first under the historical climate settings and then under a set of alternative climate trajectories based on the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP8.5 projections. I then quantified the historical and the future range of variability in the disturbance regime, seral stage distrbution, and patch configuration, and assessed departure of the current landscape from the ranges of variability using R and \textsc{Fragstats} statistical software.

During the simulated historical period, fire burned more frequently and extensively than in the past 100 years. With increasingly warm and dry future climate scenarios, burned area and the proportion of land burning at high severity increased. Due to the effects of fire on the vegetation, the current landscape departs from either historical or future conditions across a range of statistical measures. Based on these findings, I recommend that managers implement more aggressive restoration efforts, utilize mitigation measures where the consequences of changing fire regimes are socially unacceptable, and carefully consider how to balance the needs of different ecosystems as well as the communities that inhabit them. My study results can be used to inform goals and specific strategies in restoration planning and help project-level planners think about impacts at the landscape scale. After restoration, the study area can be re-analyzed to assess departure from the range(s) of variability.
