\subsubsection{Vegetation Description}
The Big Sagebrush landcover type is typified by large, open, discontinuous stands of \emph{Artemisia tridentata} of fairly uniform height. \emph{A. tridentata} tends to have a single short, thick, stem that branches into a nearly globular crown (Neal 1988). \emph{Ericameria nauseosa} is a frequent associate or co-dominant (LandFire 2007).

Shrub canopy cover generally ranges from very open, widely spaced, small plants to large, closely spaced plants with canopies touching. Cover may be greater at higher elevations and in areas receiving more precipitation. In addition to a deep root system, \emph{A. tridentata} has a well-developed system of lateral roots near the soil surface (LandFire 2007, Neal 1988). Consequently, well-established sagebrush plants exclude most other shrubs in an area up to three times their crown area. Forbs and graminoids are often more abundant beneath these crowns (Slaton pers. comm. 2013). This produces stands of shrubs of very uniform size and spacing (Neal 1988).

Often the habitat is composed of pure stands of \emph{A. tridentata}, but many stands include other species of \emph{Artemisia, Ericameria, Tetradymia, Ribes, Prunus, Cercocarpus,} and \emph{Purshia}. In communities not fully occupied by \emph{Artemisia}, various amounts of herbaceous understory are found. Perennial forb cover is usually less than 10\% with perennial grass cover reaching 20-25\% on the more productive sites. \emph{Pseudoroegneria spicata} may be a dominant species following replacement fires and a co-dominant after 20 years. \emph{Elymus elymoides} and \emph{Oryzopsis hymenoides} are common on more xeric sites. \emph{Festuca, Stipa, Poa}, and \emph{Leymus} are among the more common grasses. Percent cover and species richness of understory are determined by site limitations. \emph{Pinus monophylla} and \emph{Juniperus osteosperma} may be present, especially in areas protected from fire (Neal 1988, LandFire 2007).


\subsubsection{Distribution}
This widespread system is common to the Basin and Range province. It ranges in elevation from 900 m to 2450+ m (3000 ft - 8000+ ft) and occurs on well-drained soils on foothills, terraces, slopes, and plateaus. It is found on deeper soils (LandFire 2007).

\subsection*{Disturbances}


\subsubsection{Wildfire}
Wildfires tend to be high mortality, stand-replacing fires that initiate a process of post-fire forest succession. High mortality fires kill large as well as small shrubs, and may kill many of the forbs and grasses as well, although below-ground organs of at least some individual shrubs and herbs survive and re-sprout. 

Replacement fires generally occur where shrub canopy exceeds 25\% cover, or where grass cover is greater than 15\% and shrub cover is greater than 20\%. Surface fires occur in areas dominated by grasses but are otherwise uncommon (LandFire 2007). \emph{A tridentata} does not sprout after burning but most of the other shrubs common to the type do (Neal 1988). For the last several decades, post-settlement conversion to \emph{Bromus tectorum} has become common and results in changes to fire frequency and vegetation dynamics. Extended periods of fire suppression or absence can lead to \emph{P. monophylla-J. osteosperma} encroachment and subsequent decline of other shrubs and herbaceous plants (LandFire 2007). 

Estimates of fire rotations are available from the LandFire project and a review paper (LandFire 2007, Van de Water and Safford 2011). The LandFire project’s published fire return intervals are based on a series of associated models created using the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT). In VDDT, fires are specified concurrently with the transition that follows them. For example, a replacement fire causes a transition to the early development stage. In the RMLands model, such fires are classified as high mortality. However, in VDDT mixed severity fires may cause a transition to early development, a transition to a more open seral stage, or no transition at all. In this case, we categorize the first example as a high mortality fire, and the second and third examples as a low mortality fire. Based on this approach, we calculated fire rotations and the probability of high mortality fire for each of the three SAGE seral stages (Table~\ref{tab:sagedesc_fire}). 

\subsubsection{Other Disturbance}
Other disturbances are not currently modeled, but may, depending on the seral stage affected and mortality levels, reset patches to early development, maintain existing seral stages, or shift/accelerate succession to a more open seral stage.

\subsection*{Vegetation Seral Stages}
We recognize three separate seral stages for SAGE: Early Development (ED), Mid Development - Moderate Canopy Cover (MDM), and Late Development - Closed Canopy Cover (LDC) (Figure~\ref{sage_transmodel}). Our seral stages are an alternative to ``successional'' classes that imply a linear progression of states and tend not to incorporate disturbance. The seral stages identified here are derived from a combination of successional processes and anthropogenic and natural disturbance, and are intended to represent a composition and structural condition that can be arrived at from multiple other conditions described for that landcover type. Thus our seral stages incorporate age, size, canopy cover, and vegetation composition. In general, the delineation of stages has originated from the LandFire biophysical setting model descriptive of a given landcover type; however, seral stages are not necessarily identical to the classes identified in those models.

\caption{State and Transition Model for Big Sagebrush. Each dark grey box represents one of the three seral stages for this landcover type. Three stages of development are represented: early, middle, and late. We describe the middle development stage as characterized by moderate canopy cover and the late development stage as characterized by closed canopy cover, but these are not hard and fast rules. Transitions between states/seral stages may occur as a result of high mortality fire, low mortality fire, or succession. Specific pathways for each are denoted by the appropriate color line and arrow: red lines relate to high mortality fire, orange lines relate to low mortality fire, and green lines relate to natural succession.}

\subsubsection{Early Development (ED)}

\paragraph{Description} \emph{A. tridentata} does not sprout after burning but most of the other shrubs common to the type do. Consequently, for as long as 20 years after fire the vegetative community may be dominated by \emph{Chrysothamnus}, \emph{Tetradymia}, and grasses. A very hot fire in a degraded site may result in a seral community dominated by annual grasses and forbs. Perennial bunchgrasses frequently survive fires and become dominant (Neal 1988). Canopy cover is less than 40\%, but shrub cover may be as little as 10\%. Fuel loading is discontinuous (LandFire 2007).

\paragraph{Succession Transition} In the absence of disturbance, patches in this seral stage will transition to MDM at 20 years. 

\paragraph{Wildfire Transition} High mortality wildfire is not modeled for this seral stage. Low mortality wildfire (100\% of fires in this seral stage) maintains the patch in the ED seral stage. 

\noindent\hrulefill


\subsubsection{Mid Development - Moderate Canopy Cover (MDM)}

\paragraph{Description} \emph{A. tridentata} usually reaches fairly stable dominance 10 to 20 years after disturbance, with or without an understory of perennial bunchgrass. \emph{A. tridentata} usually remains dominant indefinitely or until the next disturbance (Neal 1988). Shrub density is sufficient in old stands to carry the fire without fine fuels. Shrubs and herbaceous vegetation can be codominant. Generally, shrub cover averages 30\% (LandFire 2007).

\paragraph{Succession Transition} At 40 years without disturbance, patches in this seral stage will transition to LDC. 

\paragraph{Wildfire Transition} High mortality wildfire (90\% of fires in this seral stage) recycles the patch through the ED seral stage. Low mortality wildfire (10\%) maintains the patch in the MDM seral stage.

\noindent\hrulefill


\subsubsection{Late Development - Closed Canopy Cover (LDC)}

\paragraph{Description} Shrublands with some encroachment from \emph{P. monophylla} and \emph{J. osteosperma} possible. Wildfire has not occurred for at least 60 years. Tree species cover is highly variable. In the continued absence of disturbance, shrub cover will decline (LandFire 2007).

\paragraph{Succession Transition} In the absence of disturbance, patches in this seral stage will maintain. 

\paragraph{Wildfire Transition} High mortality wildfire (100\% of fires in this seral stage) recycles the patch through the ED seral stage. Low mortality wildfire is not modeled for this seral stage.

\noindent\hrulefill

\subsection*{Condition Classification}
Because seral stage classification was done through orthophoto analysis, no polygons are assigned to the LDC seral stage, which is actually not an \emph{Artemisia}-dominated seral stage. Polygons with a cover value (not Null) are assigned to the MDM stage. Polygons with a Null value for shrub cover are assigned to ED.
